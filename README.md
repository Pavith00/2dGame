# Strawberry Quest

**Description:**

Strawberry Quest is a simple 2D platformer game created using the Godot game engine. The objective of the game is for the player to navigate through the level, collect strawberries to increase their score, and reach the trophy to complete the level.
I made this project to learn how to use C# in Godot for making 2D platform games. I hope in making this open source that others will also learn some things that I have learned.

**Features:**

- Basic 2D platformer mechanics.
- Player movement controls: left, right, jump.
- Collectible strawberries to increase score.
- Trophy to signify the end of the level.
- Simple scoring system.

**Controls:**

- Move Left: Left Arrow Key
- Move Right: Right Arrow Key
- Jump: Up Arrow Key

1. Download and install Godot Engine from [here](https://godotengine.org/download).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the project in Godot Engine.
4. Navigate to the main scene: `scenes/MainScene.tscn`.
5. Press the play button in Godot to start the game.
6. Use the controls to navigate the player character through the level.
